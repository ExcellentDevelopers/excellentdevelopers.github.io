## Foreword

The important day arrived. You are reading the first blog post ever published on
our platform! ...few more exclamation marks to express our happiness!!!

Most likely few seconds ago you saw on one of the social medias a link pointing
to an article with a very ambitious title mentioning software quality and excellence
which immediately resonated with your moral compass of a tech enthusiast.

Let me welcome you and thank you for investing your time. You won't regret it. I know
you are a busy person therefore let me directly jump into our short 90 sec platform introduction video.

## Platform introduction

Excuse my grammatical mistakes. First, I tried to make a perfect marketing pitch video and memorize every single word
but after few days, rounds of feedback from my colleagues pointing out the video is too robotic, artificial, I recorded
instead, a very casual, personal one achieving the same point.

I will write an article later on how a quick feedback helped me prevent spending tens of hours on a video that
would at the end, miss the point. A mistake I would do (and actually did) a year ago.

## Our mission statement, plans and goals

> To build a respectful community of developers, regardless the programming language, who
strive for excellence, professionalism and value beautiful elegant solutions
for core business requirements.

There is time for a quick MVP to validate an idea and there is time for deep
research, best practices, iterative improvements and hard work. There is time for
a hotfix release and there is time to push back our managers pressure in favor of quality.

Our main goal is to individually help every single of our readers and authors
in their career path and provide a platform that gets YOU, one step closer to excellence.

Our plan is to create an atmosphere of trust and growth by encouraging members
to write articles as well to invest their time in others by providing polite and
valuable feedback.

ExcellentDevelopers platform is running on a GitHub pages engine which means it's entirely public!
Our members can provide feedback and improve any of our articles and code examples by
directly opening new Pull Requests as well as participate in discussions with authors
in GitHub repository [Issues section](https://github.com/ExcellentDevelopers/excellentdevelopers.github.io/issues).

The following infographic explains the process in more detail:

Many of us are fortunate to have someone more experienced by our side mentoring us.

Now, imagine having an opportunity to learn from a collaboration of dozens of developers
from all over the world who put their best knowledge on the table on their favorite topics
just for the beauty of programming, as a creative art, to share knowledge and give back
to community. We all started from zero and it was the community, the teammates,
the authors of books we read that helped us to learn.

## Spoilers

We promised a sneak peek on incoming technical articles and video interviews and we
always keep our word so, here we go!

### First spoiler

In the incoming weeks we will publish an interview with a well known author of several
technical books.

### Second spoiler

We are preparing a special series of articles on building distributed
Search Engine Marketing system. We will build a tool to advertise on Google, Bing
and other major search engines using DDD, MicroServices, Messaging Systems and
other, wisely considered, trendy buzz words.

### Third spoiler

Everyone who joins our community in the next 48h will receive a special gift.

OH! And BTW! We will focus on practice. We will be building real world projects and explain, as
we go, WHY, did we use this and that pattern in this and that scenario.

At the end, excellence is achieved by repetitive action, practice and by suppressing
our egos to apply constructive feedback.
