        <h2>What's our goal?</h2>
        <p>
            No one is perfect. All though, together we can be excellent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our platform aims to collect developers from all over the world, who like to share their knowledge by
            writing technical articles with their peers willing to provide constructive feedback and directly
            suggest improvements by submitting Pull Requests against authors's articles using GIT.

            Each reader who submits their feedback, once the author merges it, will become immediately a Co-author and will be
            displayed together with the author below the article.

            The top authors profiles with links to their books/websites will be displayed on the landing page!
        </p>
        <p>
            OH! And BTW! There won't be any theoretical articles of type: "Learn Builder pattern".
            We understand how business works and that in real life, we sometimes have to action dirty hacks.
            Therefore, we will focus on practice. We will be building real world projects and explain, as
            we go, WHY, did we use this and that pattern or hack in this and that scenario and what are the pros
            and cons of a chosen solution.
